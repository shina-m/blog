<p>2 Corinthians 4:10-11 “Always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. For we who live are constantly being delivered over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh”.</p><p>This passage of scripture has been a reminder in my life to show me how to live my Christian walk daily. Bearing the cross daily is the CRUX of the Christian life, and it’s the narrow path to which our Lord Jesus has called us to follow. In my daily life, our heavenly Father in his Love shows me my weaknesses. He shows me the filthiness of my flesh (my own will to do my own thing), but He also allows me to be delivered if I’m willing to die to myself in that particular situation. This faith action is essential so that HIs resurrection power may manifest in my life and so I can be a blessing to my spouse, my relatives, or even my co-workers.</p><p>A quote blessed me by Jessie Penn-Lewis. She quotes, “The sinking down into the death of Jesus is the faith-action of the believer, and then spontaneously and unconsciously the Risen Life of Jesus springs up in gentle, silent power.”</p><p>I was struck and challenged by the first three words, “<strong>the sinking down</strong>. ” It shows me the continual dying of myself daily, and always finding an opportunity to die to a particular situation so that the risen life of Jesus may spring up. Our heavenly Father uses even the most minor crosses we carry daily. For example, just taking the responsibility of doing the house chores on a tired working day without murmuring and complaining or not talking back or stirring harshly to a wrong driver on the road are little ways our Lord can silently manifest his power. As we continue finding and taking these little opportunities to die to ourselves, God will work wonders in our inner life.</p><p>As the saying goes, “big doors swing on small hinges,” so my prayer is that our faith will not fail so that we may attain Grace from our Father. We need to be strong in the Grace in Christ Jesus- (2 Timothy 2:1). But we need to be conscious of the minor issues in our lives and violently be ready to take the opportunity to die to ourselves daily.</p></div><div class=post-info>
